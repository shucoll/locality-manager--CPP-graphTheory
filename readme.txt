Welcome to the MTE innovate project on Data Structure by Shuvam Shiwakoti

This text file gives a brief introduction to the poject and how to launch and navigate around the program.

First open this entire folder containing all the files for the project in the text editor or IDE. 

Now simply run the "main.cpp" file to execute the program in the intregrated terminal of the used IDE or text editor.
The program can also be launched direcly using the .exe file provided but the former method is suggested as that way the user can also check the code for the program.

On launching the program the user is guided into the first menu (--- Main Menu ---).
The menus in the program are self explanatory and are easy to understand and work with.
